# Thermostat

## HTML
- Decide what HTML elements you will need to serve as controls on the thermostat. Decide what HTML elements you will need to display the thermostat data.
- Build a static HTML page with these elements, labelling them with appropriate classes and/or IDs.
- You don't need to hook up your thermostat model to the user interface. That comes in the next challenge!
- Add a script tag to load your thermostat JavaScript file into the page.
- Open the developer console and check you can instantiate a thermostat object and call methods on it.
